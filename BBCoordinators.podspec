  s.description      = <<-DESC
BBCoordinators is an iOS framework, that encapsulates all navigation logic in MVVM architecture into a single element - Coordinator. It automates most of the repetitive work around creating a working navigation flow and makes it easier to maintain.

The idea is based on blog post from Soroush Khanlou http://khanlou.com/2015/10/coordinators-redux/.
